        <h2>Fun Rat Facts to Make Your Day:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Did you know? Rats are expert swimmers! They can swim up to <span class="highlight">half a mile</span> at a time. Good thing Malmö has a great canal system!</li>
            <li>Malmö is known for its bike culture, but did you know rats love to "ride" too? Their favorite mode of transportation? A trusty bike basket! 🚴‍♀️🐀</li>
            <li>Rats can live in any climate, but they’re particularly fond of Malmö's cozy cafes. You might catch a rat nibbling on a cinnamon bun in Möllan!</li>
            <li>Our rats can remember complex mazes and puzzles. So don’t challenge them unless you want a fight with a rat mastermind! 🧠🐀</li>
            <li>Did you know that rats have been spotted enjoying Malmö's parks? We've got rats in the parks, and they're looking for a new place to call home!</li>
            <li>Fun fact: Rats' whiskers are so sensitive they can detect changes in the air. So if you ever see a rat sniffing around Malmö’s Turning Torso, they’re probably figuring out the weather!</li>
        </ul>
