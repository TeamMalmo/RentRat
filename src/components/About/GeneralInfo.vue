      <h3>Our Mission</h3>
      <p>We believe every rat deserves a chance to shine, no matter their humble beginnings. That’s why we connect the rats of Malmö with humans in need of their unique skills. Each rat comes with a <strong>primary skill</strong>, a range of <strong>other talents</strong>, and an affordable <strong>hourly rate</strong>, ensuring everyone can find the perfect rodent for the job.</p>

      <h3>The Backstory: From Grit to Glory</h3>
      <p>The rats of Malmö weren’t always living the high life. Once upon a time, they roamed the city's cobbled streets, eking out a modest existence in the shadow of Kungsparken and burrowing under Möllevångstorget's market stalls. These resilient rodents had nothing but their wits, nimble paws, and a dream: to rise above their circumstances and make their mark on the city.</p>
      <p>It all started when a particularly entrepreneurial rat, <strong>Ragnar the Resourceful</strong>, realized that humans were missing out on the untapped potential of rat-kind. Why should rats merely scavenge for crumbs when they could cook, clean, paint, and even do laundry? Ragnar inspired a revolution among his furry friends, and soon the rats of Malmö were perfecting their skills and entering the world of freelance work.</p>
      <p>From their humble beginnings in underground burrows to becoming Malmö's most sought-after helpers, the rats have climbed the ladder of success. Today, their services are in high demand—proof that with hard work and a bit of rodent ingenuity, anything is possible.</p>
